# Directives

This folder contains Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) written in Markdown.

Each directive defines:
- **Goals**: What the directive aims to accomplish
- **Inputs**: What data/parameters are needed
- **Tools/Scripts**: Which execution scripts to use
- **Outputs**: Expected results
- **Edge Cases**: Known issues and how to handle them
